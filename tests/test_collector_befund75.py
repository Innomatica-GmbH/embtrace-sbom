"""Befund 75 — the collector's bill must match the suite at the SAME tree.

Measured divergences at an unconfigured libwebsockets clone (0.8.3):
1. `${LWS_WOLFSSL_…}` leaked raw into a condition — gone now that an
   option-guarded pipeline hit is an OPEN component, not a conditional.
2. Scope diverged: mbedtls/wolfssl/opus were wrongly excluded-conditional
   while the suite lists them as open build_file_only entries.
3. Self-reference filtered by the DIRECTORY name — now by the project name
   (embtrace.yaml when present), the same source the suite uses.
4. Git / a program-only Find module (OpenSSLbins) were DROPPED, while the
   suite lists them as scope=excluded — both must show the same set.

These tests build a small CMake tree that exercises each case without a
network clone.
