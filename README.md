# embtrace-sbom

> **Formerly embtrace-check.** Same tool, same code line, new name — and, from

**Reads your build, writes your bill of materials — locally.** One command in
your project folder produces a CycloneDX SBOM, including from **configured
builds** (`CMakeCache.txt`) and **Yocto/Buildroot build output** that generic
scanners cannot read. Send it explicitly if you want the free CRA readiness
report — traffic-light status against the
[EU Cyber Resilience Act](https://embtrace.dev/en/cra-nis2-guide.html), your
component inventory, known vulnerabilities with severity.

## SBOM generation for embedded builds

Most SBOM tools catalog package registries — npm, PyPI, Go, Cargo. Embedded software
is built differently: CMake, Make, Meson and Autotools source trees, Yocto images,
Buildroot, Zephyr modules, vcpkg manifests. That is what embtrace-sbom reads.

**What you get:**

- A CycloneDX 1.6 bill of materials from your **build**, not just from lockfiles —
  including the C/C++ worlds that have no package manager. Versions of system
  libraries come from the linked system (pkg-config), never guessed.
- **License and supplier** filled in on the free report for the components we can
  determine them for, from a curated knowledge base — 50,000+ entries spanning both
  worlds, from npm and Cargo to Yocto, Buildroot and CMake. The local file carries
  what your build says; the knowledge base is applied server-side.
- Test material, examples and build tools **marked as excluded** instead of counted
  as product components. Conditional dependencies are marked **optional** instead
  of being guessed into the product.
- **Nothing leaves your machine by default.** The standard run writes `sbom.cdx.json`
  next to your project and transmits nothing. Sending it to embtrace for a free CRA
  readiness report is a separate, explicit step — the tool shows you the full list
  and asks before anything is transmitted.

**Why not a generic scanner?** Measured on 2026-09-09 against syft 1.51.1 across six
embedded projects (CMake, Zephyr, Yocto, Buildroot): the generic scanner produced
zero product components for these builds. For registry ecosystems (npm, PyPI, Go),
generic scanners work well — embedded builds are the gap this tool exists for.

```
pipx install embtrace-sbom
embtrace-sbom .         # writes sbom.cdx.json, sends nothing
```

## Quickstart

```bash
pipx install embtrace-sbom          # or: pip install embtrace-sbom,
                                    #     or download the standalone binary
embtrace-sbom .                     # reads your build, writes sbom.cdx.json
                                    # — and transmits NOTHING
```

You now have your own CycloneDX SBOM. An existing `sbom.cdx.json` is never
silently overwritten.

**Free CRA readiness report** (optional): send the bill explicitly —

```bash
embtrace-sbom . --send --email you@example.com
```

You are shown exactly what would leave the house (names and versions, no
paths, no code) and asked to confirm; `--yes` skips the question in scripts.
No code is required. The report arrives within 24 hours. You can also simply
e-mail your `sbom.cdx.json` to check@innomatica.de.

More options: `embtrace-sbom --help` — including `--sbom PATH` (write the
SBOM elsewhere), `--output payload.json` for air-gapped environments (send the
file by mail) and `--with-tools` to additionally use native package-manager
CLIs for higher-fidelity results.

**Nothing leaves your machine unless you say so.** The default run transmits
nothing; `--send` shows the exact list first and asks. What a send contains —
and what it never does — is spelled out [further down](#what-a-send-contains--and-what-it-never-does).

## What a send contains — and what it never does

**If** you send (`--send`), this travels (JSON, ~a few kB):

- names, versions and package ecosystems of your dependencies
  (from lockfiles and build files: Conan, vcpkg, CMake, Cargo, npm/yarn/pnpm,
  Python incl. uv, Go, Maven/Gradle, Meson, Alire, .NET/NuGet — `packages.lock.json`,
  `<PackageReference>` in project files, `packages.config` — and more),
- **Zephyr workspaces**: the `west.yml` module manifest — every module
  with its pinned revision,
- **Yocto and Buildroot BUILD OUTPUT**: run the check in your build
  directory — it reads `deploy/images/**/*.manifest` (what is actually
  in your image) resp. `legal-info/manifest.csv`. The recipe source
  tree only says what *could* be built, so the build output is what
  counts,
- names and versions of FPGA IP cores
  (AMD/Xilinx Vivado `.hwh`/`.xci`, Microchip Libero Tcl/`.cxf`,
  Intel/Altera Quartus `*_hw.tcl`),
- the project folder name (hash it with `--anonymize`),
- scan statistics (number of build files, tool version),
- **only if you wrote them yourself** in `embtrace-deps.yaml`: the
  supplier, license, purl and CPE entries of your declaration — a
  declaration is written for SBOM purposes, so it travels by default and
  makes your report complete (58 instead of 17 attributed licenses on a
  typical Zephyr project). Withhold it with `--no-declared-metadata`.
  Discovered components never carry these fields.

**Never transmitted:** source code, file paths, file contents, configuration,
credentials. The supplier of a *detected* FPGA IP core is known locally but
deliberately **not** transmitted — a supplier you declare yourself in
`embtrace-deps.yaml` is your statement and does travel.
See for yourself before sending anything:

```bash
embtrace-sbom . --dry-run      # prints the exact payload, uploads nothing
```

Build outputs (`dist/`, `build/`, `node_modules/`, …) and hidden
directories are never scanned. Project-specific excludes go into a
committed `.embtraceignore` at the project root — one glob pattern per
line, `#` comments.

**Quality rules** (v0.6.0): component identity is (name, version,
ecosystem) — nested second versions of one package are kept as own rows
(the older nested version is often the vulnerable one); build tools and
system libraries (`Doxygen`, `-lanl`, `find_package(Git)`, …) are
dropped via a curated 950-name skip list — your own `embtrace-deps.yaml`
declarations are never skipped; `*` and guessed versions are never
reported — a missing version is shown as honestly missing. If no
supported build system is found, nothing is uploaded and the tool tells
you exactly what it looks for and where.

This collector is open source so that you can verify exactly what leaves
your machine.

## When the tool fails: the diagnosis file

A defect in embtrace-sbom must not be a silent gap in your bill, and it
must not phone home either. When a reader crashes (or the tool crashes
elsewhere), the run

- continues with the other readers and still writes the SBOM,
- says in red which reader failed (`pom.xml (KeyError)`), that the bill is
  **incomplete**, and that this is a defect in the tool, not in your project,
- writes `embtrace-sbom-diagnosis.json` next to the SBOM, names the path,
  and asks you to mail it to <support@innomatica.de>,
- ends with exit code 1.

Nothing is sent automatically — the file leaves your machine only if you
send it. Open it first. It contains: tool version, Python version, operating
system, which reader failed, the exception *type*, the call chain inside
embtrace-sbom, and the file *pattern* the reader was called for (a name from
the tool's own tables, e.g. `pom.xml` or `*.csproj`). It never contains
package names, versions, licenses, file paths, file contents, environment
variables, host names — or the exception message (a `KeyError`'s message is
a key, and a key is often a package name). The boundary is one function,
`own_frames()` in `src/embtrace_sbom/diagnosis.py`, and `tests/test_diagnosis.py`
runs a fabricated crash against canary data to prove nothing gets through.

A build system the tool does not read yet is **not** a defect: if nothing
readable is found but markers of a known-but-unread build system are
(Bazel, SCons, Keil, IAR, PlatformIO, Swift PM, Composer, …), the run keeps
exit code 2, names the markers by label and count (`bazel (2), keil (1)`),
and writes the same file with `"kind": "unsupported_build"` — labels and
counts only, no file names. Next to a build system it does read, an unread
one is named in a dim line and no file is written. Developers who want the
plain traceback set `EMBTRACE_SBOM_TRACEBACK=1`.

## Exit codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0    | success |
| 1    | error (network, missing --email with --send, a crashed reader — the bill is incomplete, diagnosis file written, …) |
| 2    | no supported build system found — declare dependencies manually in `embtrace-deps.yaml`; markers of unread build systems are named |
