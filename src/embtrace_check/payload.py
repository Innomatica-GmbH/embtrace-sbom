"""Payload models for the CRA Readiness Check upload (schema version 1).

The payload deliberately carries dependency *metadata only*: component names,
versions and ecosystems — plus, for components you declared yourself in
``embtrace-deps.yaml``, the supplier/license/purl/cpe you wrote there (the
declaration was written FOR SBOM purposes; discovered components never carry
these fields). No file paths, no source code, no hostnames. This is the
data-minimisation promise shown to the prospect via ``--dry-run``; declared
metadata can be withheld with ``--no-declared-metadata``.
