"""Local diagnosis file for a failed run — nothing leaves the machine.

Order idee-fehlerrueckmeldung-sammler (Ivan, 15.09.2026): when the tool
fails, it writes ONE local file, names the path and asks in one sentence
for a mail to support@innomatica.de. No network, no question at the end
of the run, no automatic sending. The user opens the file first.

The boundary, readable here and pinned by ``tests/test_diagnosis.py``:
**the file may contain nothing the customer would not show a stranger.**

Allowed:
    tool version, Python version, operating system (no host name), which
    reader failed, the exception TYPE, the call chain inside THIS package
    (package-relative, no absolute paths), the file PATTERN that triggered
    it (a literal from our own tables, never the customer's file name), and
    for an unsupported build the labels of build-system markers from our
    own list with their counts.

Never:
    package names, versions, licenses (the bill of materials is the
    customer's product secret), full paths (project names live there),
    file contents, environment variables, host names, and the exception
    MESSAGE — a ``KeyError``'s message is the key, and the key is often a
    package name.

Two kinds of failure are told apart, because only one is a defect:

``tool_error``
    A reader crashed (or the tool crashed outside a reader). That is a bug
    in embtrace-sbom, not in the customer's project — the bill is
    incomplete and the run ends with exit 1.
``unsupported_build``
    Nothing we read was found, but markers of build systems we do not read
    yet were. That is a roadmap line, not a bug — the run keeps exit 2.
