"""CycloneDX 1.6 output — the customer's own result, written locally.

Order collector-transparent-machen (Ivan, 09.09.2026): the default run
GENERATES, SHOWS and SAVES; it uploads nothing. What it saves must be a real
SBOM the customer can use with any other tool — not our upload payload. So
this writer emits CycloneDX 1.6 JSON from the same components the check
collected, with the honest markings the suite uses:

- ``scope`` travels ("excluded" = test material / build tooling — listed,
  never gating),
- a conditional alternative behind an off-by-default build option is
  ``scope: optional`` with its guard as a property (Befund 44: marked, never
  silently counted as present),
- ``metadata.lifecycles`` states whether this was read from a configured
  build or from declarations only (Befund 41).

No network, no upload, no telemetry: this function only formats what is
already on the customer's disk.
